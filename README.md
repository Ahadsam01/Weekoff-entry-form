# Weekoff-entry-form
Create a responsive Weekoff-entry layout
A clean, responsive Weekoff Entry form layout built with Tailwind CSS and a small amount of vanilla JavaScript. The form is designed to be mobile-first, accessible, and easy to drop into an existing dashboard or HR project. It includes dynamic behaviour such as showing a half-day selector when the "Half working day" checkbox is checked.
